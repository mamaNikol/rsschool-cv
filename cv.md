**Summary:**
- - -
I have been working as a pharmacy manager since 2010 but 
last year I realized that I want a completely different. I want to be a frontend developer. 
I started learning the basics of programming, then I understood that I like JavaScript. 
I study on my own, look for information in Google and take courses. 
I know that becoming a sought-after professional developer without a higher technical education is very difficult.
Therefore, the RSschool for me is a chance to get into the professional field, to get the necessary skills and possibly dating!
My motivation is very high and I believe that everything will work out.
